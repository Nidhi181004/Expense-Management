# Expense Management System

A comprehensive web-based expense management system built with Flask, featuring multi-role authentication, approval workflows, currency conversion, and OCR receipt scanning.

## Features

### üîê Authentication & User Management
- **Multi-role system**: Admin, Manager, Employee roles with appropriate permissions
- **Auto-company creation**: On first signup, a new company is created with country-based currency

### ‚úÖ Approval Workflows
- **Multi-level approvals**: Define complex approval workflows with multiple steps
- **Manager approval**: Automatic routing to employee's manager
- **Conditional rules**: 
  - Percentage-based approval (e.g., 60% of approvers must approve)
  - Specific approver rules (e.g., CFO approval required)
  - Hybrid rules combining both approaches
- **Sequential processing**: Expenses move through approval steps in order
- **Comments system**: Approvers can add comments when approving/rejecting

### ü§ñ OCR Receipt Scanning
- **Automatic data extraction**: Upload receipt images to auto-populate expense details
- **Smart categorization**: Automatically categorize expenses based on merchant type

- **Currency conversion**: Automatic conversion to company's base currency

### üìä Dashboard & Analytics
- **Comprehensive dashboard**: Overview of expenses, approvals, and statistics
- **Role-based views**: Different dashboard views for different user roles
- **Quick actions**: Fast access to common tasks

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Python Flask
- **Database**: SQLAlchemy with SQLite (easily configurable for PostgreSQL/MySQL)
- **Frontend**: Bootstrap 5, jQuery, Font Awesome
- **OCR**: Tesseract OCR (with mock fallback for development)
- **APIs**: REST Countries API, Exchange Rate API

# Dockerfile example
FROM python:3.9-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
EXPOSE 5000
CMD ["gunicorn", "--bind", "0.0.0.0:5000", "app:app"]
```
